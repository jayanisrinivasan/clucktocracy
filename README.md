# Clucktocracy: Pixel Coop Democracy

Clucktocracy is an agent-based simulation where chickens interact through gossip, pecking, alliances, sanctions, and policy proposals. It is a playful exploration of how hierarchies, rumors, and political structures emerge in a community.

## Purpose

This project was created as a creative experiment to explore:  
- Emergent hierarchies in multi-agent systems.  
- The role of rumors and gossip in shaping political outcomes.  
- Playful metaphors for governance, cooperation, and alignment.  

It can serve as a research toy model, a teaching tool, or a foundation for more advanced multi-agent simulations.
